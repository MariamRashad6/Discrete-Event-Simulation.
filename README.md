# Discrete Event Simulation with SimPy Library

This project implements a discrete event simulation using the SimPy library in Python. The simulation enables modeling and analysis of complex systems where events occur at specific points in time.

## Features

- **Event-Based Modeling:** The simulation is built upon the concept of discrete events, where events occur at specific points in time. This allows for accurate representation of various system behaviors and interactions.

- **Simulation Environment:** SimPy provides a simulation environment that allows you to define resources, processes, and events. It offers functionalities for process scheduling, event handling, and statistical data collection.

- **Flexible Event Scheduling:** The simulation allows you to schedule events dynamically based on system conditions and dependencies. This enables modeling of complex scenarios with events that may depend on other events or system states.

- **Statistical Analysis:** SimPy provides built-in statistical data collection capabilities, allowing you to collect and analyze simulation data. You can obtain metrics such as event durations, waiting times, and resource utilization, which are useful for performance evaluation and optimization.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- SimPy library installed. You can install it using pip:
  ````
  pip install simpy
  ```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.

3. Run the simulation using the following command:
   ````
   python simulation.py
   ```

4. The simulation will start, and you will see the output and results in the console.

## Usage

To use the simulation for your specific system or scenario, you can modify the `simulation.py` file according to your requirements. Here are some key components you may want to customize:

- **System Modeling:** Define the resources, processes, and events that make up your system. Modify the `env` object to create and manage these components.

- **Event Scheduling:** Use SimPy's event scheduling mechanisms to schedule events at specific times or based on system conditions. You can define event handlers and callbacks to perform actions when events occur.

- **Data Collection and Analysis:** Customize the data collection logic to collect relevant metrics during the simulation. Store and analyze the collected data to gain insights into the system's behavior and performance.

## Example

Here's an example scenario that demonstrates the usage of the simulation:

```python
import simpy

def event_handler(env):
    print(f"Event occurred at time {env.now}")

env = simpy.Environment()
env.process(event_handler(env))

env.run(until=10)
```

In this example, we define a simple event handler function that prints a message when an event occurs. We create a SimPy environment, add the event handler process, and run the simulation for a duration of 10 time units.
